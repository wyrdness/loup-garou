      "full": "The **Loup-Garou** (Louisiana French: *Rougarou*; Haitian Creole: *Lougarou*) is a werewolf figure born from the collision of three worlds: medieval French folklore, West African shapeshifting traditions, and Catholic moral enforcement. Found primarily in Louisiana and the Francophone Caribbean, the loup-garou represents one of the most distinctive examples of French colonial and African diaspora cultural synthesis in North America. Unlike its European werewolf ancestors, the Louisiana Rougarou prowls the bayous and swamps hunting those who break Lenten fasts or skip Mass. In Haiti, the Lougarou emerges from Vodou witchcraft—a cursed soul who made pacts with dark spirits. The curse typically lasts **101 days and nights**, during which the afflicted transforms nightly into a wolf-like creature with an insatiable hunger. The loup-garou's most distinctive feature is its **curse transference mechanism**: the only way to break free is to have your blood drawn by another person who must then keep the act secret for exactly 101 days. Reveal the secret, and the curse returns. Keep it, and you've damned another soul to take your place. Part cautionary tale, part religious enforcement, part cultural memory—the loup-garou embodies the complex heritage of French Louisiana and the Caribbean, where European colonialism, African spirituality, and Catholic theology merged into unique Creole cultures."
