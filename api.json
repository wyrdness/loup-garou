      "summary": "A werewolf figure of French colonial and African diaspora origin found in Louisiana, Haiti, and the Francophone Caribbean. Unlike European werewolves, the loup-garou curse often has Catholic and Vodou connections, transforming victims for specific periods (often 101 days) and transferable through blood-letting.",
      "full": "The Loup-Garou represents a unique fusion of French werewolf traditions, West African shapeshifting beliefs, and Catholic theology adapted through Louisiana Creole and Caribbean cultures. Emerging from French colonial settlements and the African slave trade, the loup-garou is both a cautionary figure enforcing religious and social norms and a manifestation of colonial anxieties. In Louisiana, the Rougarou prowls bayous and swamps, hunting those who break Lenten fasts or disobey Catholic law. In Haiti, the Lougarou connects to Vodou witchcraft, often appearing as a cursed individual who made pacts with dark spirits. The curse typically lasts 101 days and nights, and can be broken or transferred by drawing the creature's blood without revealing the act for a full year. The loup-garou embodies the complex cultural synthesis of the French colonial world, African spiritual systems, and Creole identity formation."
